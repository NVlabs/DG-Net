## Features
We have supported:
- Float16 to save GPU memory based on [APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex)
- Multiple query evaluation
- Random erasing
- Visualize training curves
- Generate all figures in the paper 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- GPU Memory >= 15G 
- GPU Memory >= 10G (for fp16)
- NumPy
- PyTorch 1.0+
- [Optional] APEX (for fp16)

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install PyTorch from http://pytorch.org/
- Install torchvision from the source:
```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision
cd vision
python setup.py install
```
- [Optinal] You may skip it. Install APEX from the source:
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
cd apex
python setup.py install --cuda_ext --cpp_ext
```
- Clone this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/DG-Net.git
cd DG-Net/
```

Our code is tested on PyTorch 1.0.0+ and torchvision 0.2.1+ .

### Dataset Preparation
Download the dataset [Market-1501](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_reid.html) 

Preparation: put the images with the same id in one folder. You may use 
```bash
python prepare-market.py          # for Market-1501
```
Note to modify the dataset path to your own path.

### Testing

#### Download the trained model
We provide our trained model. You may download it from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lL18FZX1uZMWKzaZOuPe3IuAdfUYyJKH) or ([BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1503831XfW0y4g3PHir91yw) password: rqvf). You may download and move it to the `outputs`.

#### Person re-id evaluation

|   | Market-1501  | Duke  | MSMT-17  | CUHK03-NP |
|---|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Rank@1 | 94.8% | 86.6% | 77.2% | 65.6% |
| mAP    | 86.0% | 74.8% | 52.3% | 61.1% |

For more details, please check the `README.md` in the `./reid_eval`.

#### Image generation evaluation

Please check the `README.md` in the `./visual_tools`. 

You may use the `./visual_tools/test_folder.py` to generate lots of images and then do the evaluation. The only thing you need to modify is the data path.

- SSIM https://github.com/layumi/PerceptualSimilarity

- FID https://github.com/layumi/TTUR  (To evaluate, you need to install `tensorflow-gpu`)


### Training

#### Train a teacher model
You may directly download our trained teacher model from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lL18FZX1uZMWKzaZOuPe3IuAdfUYyJKH) or ([BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1503831XfW0y4g3PHir91yw) password: rqvf).
If you want to have it trained by yourself, please check the [person re-id baseline](https://github.com/layumi/Person_reID_baseline_pytorch) repository to train a teacher model, then copy and put it in the `./models`.
```
├── models/
│   ├── best/                   /* teacher Model for Market-1501
│       ├── net_last.pth        /* model file
│       ├── ...
```

#### Train DG-Net 
1. Setup the yaml file. Check out `configs/latest.yaml`. Change the data_root field to the path of your prepared folder-based dataset, e.g. `../Market-1501/pytorch`.


2. Start training
```
python train.py --config configs/latest.yaml
```
Or train with low precision (fp16)
```
python train.py --config configs/latest-fp16.yaml
```
Intermediate image outputs and model binary files are saved in `outputs/latest`.

3. Check the loss log
```
 tensorboard --logdir logs/latest
```

## Tips
Note the format of the camera id and the number of cameras.

For some datasets (e.g., MSMT17), there are more than 10 cameras. You need to modify the preparation and evaluation code to read the double-digit camera id.

For some vehicle re-id datasets (e.g., VeRi) having different naming rules, you also need to modify the preparition and evaluation code.
